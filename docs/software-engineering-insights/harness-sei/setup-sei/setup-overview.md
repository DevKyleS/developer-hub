This page walks you through how to configure Software Engineering Insights (SEI) 2.0 for your organization, from setting up integrations and org trees to assigning developers and viewing insights. 

Follow these steps to get started and customize SEI 2.0 to your team's structure and goals.

### Set up integrations and your org structure

To start using SEI 2.0, you can [configure integrations](./configure-integrations) with your organization's source control, CI/CD, and ticketing tools. Once your integrations are in place, [create org trees](./setup-org-tree) to define your team structure and reporting relationships in SEI 2.0. You can then [add developers](./upload-developer-records) and assign them to teams to begin tracking insights.

### Define performance benchmarks

Next, [create an efficiency profile](./setup-profiles/efficiency-profile) to define performance benchmarks that reflect your organizationâ€™s goals. You can also [configure team settings](./setup-teams) to fine-tune how SEI 2.0 attributes work to each team, including backfill options and label filters.

### Explore insights

Once setup is complete, you can [view insights at the org tree level](./view-insights/insights) to understand how your organization is performing overall, or [view insights for a specific team](./view-insights/granular-insights) to dive deeper into team-level performance data.

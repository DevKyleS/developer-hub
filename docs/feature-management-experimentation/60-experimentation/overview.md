Experiments measure the success of your website, application, back-end performance, etc. Experiment metric results tell you if your new features are improving, degrading, or having no effect on your application users’ experience.

Experiments take in your experimental control variables, measure events, and display the results. Your experiment will show you if the data is in correct ratios (a passing health check), the running time has completed, and the results are conclusive, equipping you with data to drive your product decisions.

## Create an experiment

For any experimentation program to be successful, teams should be able to remain agile and create repeatable steps. These steps give teams an outline for the who, what, when and where of experimentation.  From conception to iteration, it is important that teams optimize the process itself as they go along, in order to move faster. 

For more information about creating an experiment, see the [Setup documentation](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/experimentation/setup/).

## Use tags to organize experiments

You can add **tags** to experiments to make it easier to search, filter, and apply standards. Tags are flexible labels that let you group experiments by team, purpose, status, or any internal conventions. 

Learn more about [experiment tags](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/management-and-administration/tags/).

## Analyze experiment results

For more information about analyzing experiment results, see [Analyzing experiment results](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/experimentation/experiment-results/analyzing-experiment-results).

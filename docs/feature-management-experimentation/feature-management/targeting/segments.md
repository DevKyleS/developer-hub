The **Segments** page in Harness Feature Management & Experimentation (FME) provides a centralized list view for searching and managing your <Tooltip id="fme.feature-management.segment">segments</Tooltip>. You can search, filter, and organize segments before drilling into an individual segment's definition.

![](../../static/segments-1.png)

:::info Starred Segments
You can click the ⭐ **Star** icon next to any segment to add it to your **Starred segments**, making it easier to return to frequently used segments.
:::

Each segment appears as a row in the list with the following information: 

| Column name      | Description                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Name**         | The segment name.                                                  |
| **Owners**       | The users responsible for managing the segment.                    |
| **Tags**         | Labels used to categorize segments.                                |
| **Traffic Type** | The traffic type the segment applies to.                           |
| **Segment Type** | Whether the segment is **Standard**, **Large**, or **Rule-based**. |

## Search and manage segments

You can find the segments you're interested in by using the following search and filter options:

![](../../static/segments-2.png)

* **Search by name**: Search for segments by name.
* **Starred**: Show only segments you’ve starred.
* **Owned by me**: Show segments you created or where you are listed as an owner.
* **Search by tags**: Filters segments by one or more tag values.
* **Filter by traffic type**: Narrows results by traffic types such as `user`, `account`, or `anonymous`.
* **Segment type filter**: Use the **Standard** dropdown to filter by `Standard`, `Large`, or `Rule-based` segments.

Selecting a segment from the list open its details, including the following tabs: 

- **Segment definition**, where you can define and manage user membership for each environment
- **Audit logs**, where you can review changes made to a segment over time

Segments represent groups of users that feature flags can target across environments. In Harness FME, standard and large segments define membership explicitly; rule-based segments dynamically include users based on targeting rules that are evaluated at runtime. Segments can be managed in Harness or programmatically using the [Split Admin API](https://docs.split.io/reference/create-segment), and can optionally sync with any [Amplitude Cohort](https://amplitude.com/docs/data/destination-catalog/split).

Segments help you organize and target users for feature releases, testing, and experimentation across your environments. For feature releases, you can use segments to:

  * **Ensure quality testing.** Release to your internal or outsourced QA team by creating a `qa_team` segment.
  * **Target employees for internal testing.** Release to your entire company to test a feature or gather feedback by creating an `employees` segment.
  *  **Plan your release strategy.** Release to a group of customers who have expressed interest in a particular feature by creating a `beta_tester` segment.

These examples demonstrate how segments help you safely and effectively target users during feature releases.

## Segment types

Harness FME supports the following segment types:
  * **Standard segments** - can contain up to 100,000 user IDs
  * **Large segments** - can contain up to 1,000,000 user IDs (may be increased upon request)
  * **Rule-based segments** - dynamically include user IDs based on [targeting rules](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/feature-management/setup/define-feature-flag-treatments-and-targeting#targeting-rules) 

:::info
**Large segments** are available on the [Enterprise](https://www.split.io/pricing/) plan.
:::

:::warning[Server-side SDK support for Large segments]
Server-side SDKs do not yet support Large segments, but soon will. Until they are supported, evaluations of feature flags that target Large segments will return `control` on server-side SDKs. 
:::

:::warning[Server-side SDK initialization time with Standard segments]
When you add user IDs to a segment, note that these are lists that need to be fully downloaded to all of our ___server side___ SDKs. Too many IDs in a segment mean that your SDKs take longer to get ready.
:::

**Large segments** are created and managed differently than standard segments. A brief summary:
  * Creating and updating Large segments is done in _two steps_, including using Split API to upload a CSV file containing the segment's _full list_ of user IDs.
  * In Harness FME, you can search a Large segment for a given User ID, but the full list of user IDs in a Large segment cannot be displayed.

The segment type is displayed at the top of each Segment page in Harness FME, as shown below.

## Creating a segment

When creating a segment, the segment name, description, owners, and tags can help you and your team later manage your segment. This information can be customized to your team's workflow.

To create a segment:

1. From the navigation bar, click **Create segment**. The Create a segment page appears.

   <div style={{maxWidth:700}}> ![](../static/create-a-segment-page-1.png) </div>
    
2. Fill in the fields as follows:
  * **Name.** Give your segment an easily recognizable name.

    :::info[Segment name requirements]
    Segment names must start with a letter and can contain the characters - _ a-z A-Z 0-9. Segment names are case sensitive. Note that segment names cannot specifically be called *datetime*, *string*, or *integer*.
    :::
  * **Segment type.** Select a segment type.
  * **Traffic type.** Select a traffic type for this segment. The feature flags that target this segment must be assigned the same traffic type.
  * **Owners.** Add one or more owners to your segment. Use owners to isolate segments in the list to those *owned by me*.
  * **Tags.** Optionally add one or more tags to help you categorize the segment. Use tags to isolate to a particular team or feature release (e.g. reporting team, front end, or geo search release).
  * **Description.** Optionally, provide a description of the segment. This helps your team members understand the segment's purpose.

3. Click **Create** to create your new segment. This takes you to the segment details page with the **Definition** and **Audit Logs** tabs.

### Adding user IDs to a segment

You need to add a segment definition for a given environment (this creates an empty segment in that environment) and then add user IDs to the segment. This is done as follows:

1. Select a segment in the Segments pane to open the segment page.

   ![](../static/create-a-segment-add-definition.png)

2. In the Environment dropdown, select a Harness FME environment where the segment will be defined.

3. Click **Add definition**. A new blank definition for the segment (for the selected environment) appears.

4. In the User section, click **Add user**.

   ![](../static/create-a-segment-add-user.png)

    ___For Standard segments___ you can choose to individually add user IDs or to add them via file import.

    ___For Large segments___ user IDs are added via file import using Split API.

    For details about the import file contents, see the [CSV import file format](#csv-import-file-format) section below.

#### File import for Standard segments

When using file import for a Standard segment, the user IDs listed in the file are ___added___ to the IDs already in the segment. Duplicate IDs are not added. This means that you can repeatedly import up to 10,000 user IDs at a time until the 100,000 limit is reached. (This is different from the way file import works for Large segments.)

#### File import for Large segments

When using file import for a Large segment, the list of user IDs in the file will ___replace___ all the IDs that were already in the segment. The import file contents represent the new segment version and overwrite the previous segment version.

To import user IDs into a Large segment you need to prepare a [CSV import file](#csv-import-file-format). Then do the following:

1. On the segment page, click **Add user** and select **Import via API**.

   ![](../static/create-a-segment-import-via-api.png)

2. On the Change summary page, click **Save** to generate an upload URL.

   ![](../static/create-a-segment-upload-url.png)

    The upload URL will time out after 5 minutes, and the Large segment change request will be automatically withdrawn if the upload URL was not used.

3. Copy the Upload URL by clicking the copy icon. You are actually copying a curl command to upload a CSV file using a Split API endpoint. The command has the following format:

<ul>

```
curl -XPUT -H 'Host: split-large-segments-....' \
   'https://split-large-segments-...' \
   -T filename.csv
```

</ul>

<p style={{marginLeft: '2em'}}>
Replace `filename.csv` with the name of your CSV file.
</p>

4. Run the curl command from the location of your CSV file. You may need to wait a moment for the command to complete. During this time, the segment will show pending changes in Harness.

   ![](../static/create-a-segment-pending.png)

5. Refresh the Segment page to see the segment size updated. You can search for a user ID to confirm that it is in the Large segment.

   ![](../static/create-a-segment-search.png)

### Append user IDs to a Large segment

A segment is a list of user IDs. To append new user IDs to an existing list for a Large segment:

1. Export the user IDs in the Large segment.

  You can export past versions of a Large segment: Click into a change on the Segment page Audit logs tab, and then click an **Export** link to download a CSV file. (Past versions are stored for 90 days.)

2. Edit the exported CSV file and insert the new user IDs.

3. Upload the edited CSV file using the **[File import for Large segments](#file-import-for-large-segments)** steps.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rule" label="Rule-based">

Rule-based segments define membership dynamically using [targeting rules](https://www.harness.io/harness-devops-academy/targeting-rules), rather than a fixed list of user IDs. While the creation flow is similar to Standard and Large segments, the segment definition is configured using targeting rules instead of user IDs.

To define a rule-based segment:

1. Select the appropriate environment for the segment definition from the dropdown menu, for example: `Prod` or `Staging`.
1. In the **Definition** tab of a segment, click **Add definition**.
   
   ![](../../static/segments-3.png)

1. In the **Targeting** section, click **+ Add new rule**. 
1. Add a targeting rule to be evaluated at runtime. For each rule, you can configure an `IF` condition using user attributes or the following `User` options: **Is in segment**, **Is not in segment**, **Is in list**, and **Is not in list**. 
   
   ![](../../static/segments-4.png)

   Once you've selected a condition, select or enter a corresponding segment, list, or attribute value. To refine a rule, click **+** to add additional conditions. All conditions in an `AND` block must be satisfied for the rule to match.
   
   ![](../../static/segments-5.png)

   To define additional branches, click **+ Add new rule** to create an `ELSE IF` rule. Rules are evaluated in order, from top to bottom.

1. In the **Excluded targets** section, you can exclude users or segments from the segment definition, even if they match the [targeting rules](/docs/feature-management-experimentation/feature-management/setup/define-feature-flag-treatments-and-targeting#targeting-rules). Excluded targets are always removed from the final segment membership.

   ![](../../static/segments-6.png)

   * Add users to exclude in the `To user` field.
   * Select the segments to exclude in the `To segments` field. <br /><br />
1. Click **Review changes** to submit a change request.
1. Add a title, a description of your change, and optionally, include approvers.
1. Click **Save**.
   
   ![](../../static/segments-7.png)

After saving, your changes are recorded in the **Audit logs** tab.

* In environments that require a change request, the changes appear as an entry once the request is approved. 
* In environments without a change request workflow, changes are saved immediately and appear.

![](../../static/segments-8.png)

You can use the `Filter by` dropdown menu to filter the entries by:

| Filter type       | Options                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Change type**   | `Created`, `Added user`, `Removed user`, `Updated tags`, `Updated owners` |
| **Change status** | `Published`, `Rejected`, `Requested`, `Withdrawn`                         |

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Deleting a segment

You can delete a segment with all of its keys instead of deleting each segment key individually.

Follow these steps to delete all keys from the segment and delete the segment:

1. Locate the down arrow on top of the checkboxes column.
1. Click on it to display two menu items.
   
   ![](../static/delete-1.png)

1. Select all records from there. The **Delete** button appears.

   ![](../static/delete-2.png)

1. Once the keys are deleted, delete the segment definition by clicking on the Ellipses icon in the **Definition** section and selecting **Delete definition**.
   
   ![](../static/delete-3.png)

1. Click on the Ellipses icon above **Owners** and select **Delete**.
   
   ![](../static/delete-4.png)

## CSV import file format

When adding user keys to a segment by importing them from a file, use a CSV file (a file with .csv extension) that lists the user IDs in a single column with no header. User IDs containing commas, line breaks, or any other special character need to be wrapped in double quotes. Duplicate user IDs are ignored.

Example CSV file content:

```
id1
id2
id3
```

## Uploading user IDs with commas in CSV files

When uploading CSV files with user IDs that contain commas, do not manually add double quotes around the IDs. The CSV import automatically treats each line as a unique user ID and adds any necessary quotes during import. For example, instead of:

```
"user1, key1"
"user2, key2"
```

use:

```
user1, key1
user2, key2
```

This ensures the user IDs are imported correctly into the segment.

## Checking if a user is in a segment

The Admin API does not include an endpoint to check if a user ID (or key) exists in a specific segment. Instead, you can use the mobile and browser SDK's `memberships` endpoint, which returns the list of segment names associated with a given user key.

When calling this endpoint, use a Browser API key:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [Browser API Key]" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     https://sdk.split.io/api/memberships/[user_id]
```

For example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ebj1kXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     https://sdk.split.io/api/memberships/testing4321
```

The example response returns the following:

```json
{
  // "ms" is short for "mySegments". 
  // In this case, the user is only a member of the "First_Class_Users" regular segment.
  "ms": {
    "k": [{
      "id": "460f69f0-f426-11e8-92e6-0ed4073e2658",
      "n": "First_Class_Users"
    }]
  },
  // "ls" is short for "myLargeSegments". 
  // In this case, the user is not a member of any large segments.
  "ls": {
    "k": []
  }
}
```

This approach is faster and more efficient than fetching all keys for all segments via the Admin API and looping through them.

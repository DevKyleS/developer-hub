CDEs are pre-configured, remote, ready-to-use environments that developers can quickly spin up from anywhere and start writing code, debugging, and collaborating with other developers. Note that while the module name is Harness CDE, we will be calling the Harness-created CDEs with a special name called Gitspaces :tm:

Overall a Harness CDE comprises of an **IDE integration**, **Cloud Compute** or Machine and integration for **Source Code Management** tools.

This topic describes the prerequisites and checks that should be fulfilled before proceeding to create an environment, an infrastructure and execute chaos experiments using Harness CE SaaS version.

- Access to a Harness account: Sign up [here](https://app.harness.io) in case you don't have an account already. 
- Your target application: A cloud-native microservices application.
- The prerequisites are listed in the table format that maps every prerequisite with the type and the user persona. For example, your application requires network connectivity (a part of your infrastructure) which is obtained with the help of a cluster administrator or a platform engineer.


| **Prerequisite**                         | **Type**                      | **User Persona**                                                     | **Notes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Harness RBAC                             | Harness project configuration | Harness admin                                                        | Prepare yourself with the [right permissions](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/rbac-in-harness/) (`Chaos Resources Role Permissions` in `Access Control`). Your target system or application can reside on a VM or a K8s cluster, prepare accordingly.                                                                                             |
| Cluster / Target / Host RBAC             | User infrastructure           | Cluster / Windows / Linux admin                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Image registry                           | User infrastructure           | Platform engineer / Cluster admin                                    | Identify image registry requirements and steps to set up the registry with secrets: Chaos experiments use Docker images that need to be stored in a repository. In HCE, these images are hosted in [image registry](/docs/chaos-engineering/use-harness-ce/image-registry).                                                                                                            |
| Runtime permissions                      | User infrastructure           | Cluster / Windows / Linux admin                                      | Prepare yourself with the respective permissions on the cloud account or the [Kubernetes cluster](/docs/category/permissions) or the VM (Kube RBAC, [IAM Roles](/docs/chaos-engineering/use-harness-ce/chaos-faults/aws/security-configurations/aws-iam-integration)): Depending on the platform where you wish to execute your chaos experiments, you will need specific permissions. |
| Resource constraints                     | User infrastructure           | Cluster / Windows / Linux admin                                      | Ensure that you [configure the namespace](/docs/chaos-engineering/security/namespace-considerations) in the right manner to limit the exposure of all services of your application.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Harness Feature Flags                    | Harness account configuration | Harness admin                                                        | Enable the necessary Feature Flags (as a general step) and corresponding sanity checks (such as places to click, and entities to see enabled): Some features may be behind a Feature Flag. You can contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable the flag feature for your account.                                                                                   |
| Application Observability                | User infrastructure           | App developer / Platform engineer                                    | You can use Prometheus, Grafana or other monitoring tools to observe how your application behaves during and after chaos injection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

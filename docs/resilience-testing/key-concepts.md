# Key Concepts

This guide covers the essential terminology and concepts for Harness Resilience Testing.

## Chaos Engineering

Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system to build confidence in its capability to withstand turbulent and unexpected conditions in production.

### Core Principles

#### Steady State Hypothesis

The **steady state** represents your system's normal operating condition. Before running chaos experiments, you define:
- Measurable system outputs that indicate normal behavior
- Baseline metrics using Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
- Acceptable thresholds for system performance

**Example**: "Our API should maintain 99.9% availability with response times under 200ms during normal operations."

#### Blast Radius

The scope of impact a chaos experiment can have on your system. Best practices:
- Start small with non-critical systems or components
- Gradually increase experiment scope as confidence grows
- Use infrastructure controls to limit impact
- Implement automatic rollback mechanisms

#### Hypothesis-Driven Testing

Each chaos experiment follows a scientific approach:
1. **Identify** the steady state and specify SLOs
2. **Hypothesize** what will happen when a fault is injected
3. **Inject** the failure in a controlled manner with minimal blast radius
4. **Validate** whether the system maintains steady state and meets SLOs

### Key Components

#### Chaos Experiments

A [chaos experiment](./chaos-testing/experiments) is a set of operations coupled together to inject faults into a target resource and validate the system's resilience. Each experiment:
- Targets specific infrastructure or application components
- Injects one or more chaos faults in a defined sequence
- Uses probes to validate system behavior
- Can include custom actions for notifications or integrations
- Generates a resilience score based on results

#### Chaos Faults

[Chaos faults](/docs/chaos-engineering/faults/chaos-faults) are pre-built failure scenarios that simulate real-world issues:

#### Fault Categories
- **Kubernetes Faults**: Pod deletions, container kills, resource stress
- **Cloud Platform Faults**: AWS, GCP, Azure service disruptions
- **Infrastructure Faults**: CPU stress, memory exhaustion, network latency, disk pressure
- **Application Faults**: Service failures, error injection, timeout simulation

Harness provides 200+ ready-to-use chaos faults in the Enterprise ChaosHub.

#### Resilience Probes

[Resilience probes](./chaos-testing/probes) are health validation mechanisms that run during chaos experiments to verify your system maintains its steady state:

#### Probe Modes
- **Continuous Mode**: Monitor throughout experiment duration
- **Edge Mode**: Check at specific experiment phases (before, during, after)
- **OnChaos Mode**: Validate only during fault injection

#### Probe Types
- **HTTP Probe**: Validate API endpoints and services
- **Command Probe**: Execute custom commands and validate output
- **Prometheus Probe**: Query Prometheus metrics
- **Datadog Probe**: Query Datadog metrics
- **Dynatrace Probe**: Query Dynatrace metrics

#### Actions

[Actions](./chaos-testing/actions) are custom tasks that execute within experiments:
- Send notifications to Slack, PagerDuty, or email
- Trigger webhooks for external integrations
- Execute custom scripts or commands
- Add delays between experiment steps
- Integrate with monitoring and observability tools

#### ChaosHub

A [ChaosHub](./chaos-testing/chaoshub) is a centralized repository for reusable chaos engineering resources:

#### Enterprise ChaosHub
- Provided by Harness with 200+ chaos faults
- Regularly updated with new faults and improvements
- Available across all projects and organizations

#### Custom ChaosHub
- Create your own hub for organization-specific resources
- Store custom experiment templates
- Share probe templates across teams
- Version control using Git integration

#### Chaos Infrastructure

[Chaos infrastructure](./chaos-testing/infrastructure/infrastructures) represents the target environment where chaos experiments execute:

#### Deployment Models
- **Agent-Based**: Deploy chaos agents on Linux or Windows hosts
- **Agentless**: Use Harness Delegate for Kubernetes and cloud resources

#### Supported Targets
- Kubernetes clusters (EKS, GKE, AKS, OpenShift)
- Linux and Windows hosts
- AWS, GCP, Azure cloud resources
- VMware infrastructure

## Load Testing

Load Testing validates that your system can handle expected and peak traffic while maintaining performance and reliability.

**Key Concepts** (Coming Soon):
- Traffic patterns and virtual users
- Performance metrics (response time, throughput, error rate)
- Bottleneck identification
- Auto-scaling validation

## Disaster Recovery Testing

Disaster Recovery Testing validates that backup systems, failover mechanisms, and recovery procedures work during catastrophic scenarios.

**Key Concepts** (Coming Soon):
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- Failover mechanisms and backup validation
- Business continuity planning
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Harness Resilience Testing Concepts

These concepts apply across all resilience testing activities in the Harness platform.

### Environments

Logical groupings of your infrastructure where tests are executed:
- Organize resources by purpose (dev, staging, production)
- Control access and permissions per environment
- Isolate test execution to specific infrastructure scopes

### Governance

Controls and policies to ensure safe, controlled testing:

#### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
Fine-grained permissions for who can:
- Create and modify tests
- Execute tests on specific infrastructure
- View results and analytics
- Manage governance policies

#### ChaosGuard

[ChaosGuard](./chaos-testing/governance/governance-in-execution) provides advanced governance specifically for chaos experiments:
- Define when experiments can run (time windows)
- Specify where experiments can execute (infrastructure scope)
- Control what faults can be injected (fault restrictions)
- Set approval requirements for high-risk tests

### GameDays

[GameDays](./chaos-testing/gamedays) are coordinated resilience testing exercises:
- Plan and schedule multiple tests together
- Simulate real incident scenarios
- Practice team response procedures
- Validate runbooks and recovery processes

### Risks

Automated identification and tracking of system weaknesses:
- **Resilience Risks**: Potential failure points in your system
- **Performance Risks**: Bottlenecks and capacity issues
- **Compliance Risks**: Gaps in meeting RTO/RPO targets

Risks are discovered automatically and can be validated through targeted tests.

# Configure Policies and Policy Sets

Dependency Firewall uses Harness Policy as Code to evaluate artifacts against security rules. To get started, you'll need to create policies and policy sets that define the evaluation criteria for your upstream proxy registries.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring policies for Dependency Firewall, familiarize yourself with Harness Policy as Code:

- [Harness Governance Overview](/docs/platform/governance/policy-as-code/harness-governance-overview) - Learn about policies, policy sets, and how they work in Harness
- [Harness Governance Quickstart](/docs/platform/governance/policy-as-code/harness-governance-quickstart) - Step-by-step guide to creating your first policy and policy set

Policies are written in Rego, the policy language from Open Policy Agent (OPA). If you're new to Rego, check out the free [OPA Policy Authoring course](https://academy.styra.com/courses/opa-rego).

## Dependency Firewall Policy Templates

When creating a policy in the Harness Policy Library, you'll find built-in templates specifically designed for Dependency Firewall. You can use these templates as-is, customize them to match your requirements, or create your own custom policies from scratch using the Rego language.

**CVSS Threshold**
Evaluates artifacts based on Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores. Use this template to block or warn about vulnerabilities above a certain severity level. You can customize the threshold values to match your organization's risk tolerance.

**License Policy**
Checks artifact licenses against your organization's approved or blocked license list. This template helps ensure compliance with your licensing requirements by evaluating whether an artifact's license is allowed for use. You can modify the allowed list to customize which licenses are acceptable for your organization.

**Package Age**
Evaluates artifacts based on their age or release date. Use this template to block newly released packages during a cooldown period, helping prevent the use of untested versions that may contain security issues or bugs.

:::tip
You can edit any of these templates or create completely custom policies using Rego. The templates provide a solid foundation that you can modify to suit your specific security requirements.

**Important**: When customizing policies, ensure that the output format of the policy remains the same. The Dependency Firewall expects a specific output structure to properly evaluate and categorize violations.

**Entity Type for Dependency Firewall**

When creating or editing policies for Dependency Firewall, you must select the entity type: **Upstream Proxy**. This entity type is specific to Dependency Firewall and ensures that your policy appears in the policy library when creating policy sets for upstream proxy registries.

## Creating Policy Sets

To create and enforce a policy set for Dependency Firewall:

1.  Follow the standard process for [creating a policy set](/docs/platform/governance/policy-as-code/harness-governance-quickstart#step-3-create-a-policy-set) in Harness. When creating the policy set, make sure to:
   - Set the **Entity Type** to **Upstream Proxy**
   - Set **On what event should the policy set be evaluated** to **On Evaluation**
   - Select the scope where the policy set will apply (Account, Organization, or Project level)
   - Click **Add Policy** and select the Dependency Firewall policies you created earlier
   - Save the policy set

2. Enable enforcement by navigating to the **Policy Sets** list, finding your Dependency Firewall policy set, and toggling the **Enforced** switch to ON.

<DocImage path={require('./static/toggle.png')} />

When enforced, the policy set automatically applies to all upstream proxy registries with Dependency Firewall enabled within the policy set's scope. Account level applies to all upstream proxy registries in the account, Organization level applies to all upstream proxy registries in that organization, and Project level applies only to upstream proxy registries in that specific project.

:::note Important
Policy sets only apply to upstream proxy registries that have Dependency Firewall enabled. Make sure to [enable Dependency Firewall](/docs/artifact-registry/manage-registries/configure-registry#enable-dependency-firewall) in your upstream proxy registry configuration.

This document provides a comprehensive guide to configuring databases with SSL, including secret and delegate configurations, setting up for JDBC test connections, and pipeline permissions. It covers the necessary steps to set up and manage certificates for secure communication between database and other services.

## 1. SSL Support by Integration Type

SSL handling differs based on how Database DevOps interacts with external systems. Use the table below to confirm support and configuration scope.

| Functionality Type | SSL Support | Transport Layer | Cert Management | Notes |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Git (Schema Cloning)         | ✅ Yes       | HTTPS           | Mounted certs (`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt`) | [More Info](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/configure-a-kubernetes-build-farm-to-use-self-signed-certificates/) |
| Artifactory (Schema Cloning) | ❌ No        | HTTP            | N/A                                            | SSL not supported for Artifactory-based schema cloning                                                                                                                                               |
| Database Connections (JDBC)  | ✅ Yes       | JDBC over SSL   | Requires importing DB certs into truststore    | See [Connector Setup Guide](https://developer.harness.io/docs/database-devops/use-database-devops/set-up-connectors/)                                                                                |

:::info Reference Architecture
Harness Database DevOps reuses the same Kubernetes build infrastructure mechanisms as Harness CI for certificate handling. 

If you are unfamiliar with certificate mounting in Kubernetes build pods, review: 👉 Configure a Kubernetes build farm to [use self-signed certificates](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/configure-a-kubernetes-build-farm-to-use-self-signed-certificates/)
:::

## 2. Prepare Required Certificates
Ensure you have the following files available locally:

* CA Bundle - `ca.crt` (commonly contains `ca.crt`, used by both client and server)
    - Generate [CA certificate](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/secure-delegates/delegate-mtls-support/#create-a-ca-certificate)
    - Manage [CA bundles and secrets](https://developer.harness.io/docs/continuous-integration/use-ci/set-up-build-infrastructure/k8s-build-infrastructure/configure-a-kubernetes-build-farm-to-use-self-signed-certificates/#enable-self-signed-certificates)
    
    :::info Important Notes
    -  In most environments, a single CA signs both client and server.
    -  If separate CAs are used, both must be included in the CA bundle.
    :::

* Client Certificate - `client.crt` and `client.key` needs to be manually created by the user. Learn how to Generate [client certificates](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/secure-delegates/delegate-mtls-support/#create-a-client-certificate). Certificates are mounted once on the delegate and selectively injected into build pods using `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES`.

:::info note
**Minimum versions**
* **db-devops-service** -  `1.32.x`
* **drone-liquibase** -  `plugins/drone-liquibase:1.1.0-4.27`
* **drone-liquibase-mongo** -  `plugins/drone-liquibase:1.1.0-4.27-mongo`
* **drone-liquibase-spanner** -  `plugins/drone-liquibase:1.1.0-4.27-spanner`
:::

## 3. Create the Kubernetes Secret

Create a Kubernetes secret containing all certificates.

```shell
kubectl create secret -n <namespace> generic dbops-ssl-secret \
  --from-file=ca.bundle \
  --from-file=client.crt \
  --from-file=client.key
```

:::info note
Ensure that the key names (`ca.bundle`, `client.crt`, `client.key`) match exactly with what your database client expects. If your database client expects ca.crt instead of ca.bundle:

```shell
kubectl create secret -n <namespace> generic dbops-ssl-secret \
  --from-file=ca.crt=ca.bundle \
  --from-file=client.crt \
  --from-file=client.key
```
:::

## 4. Mount Certificates into the Delegate

1. Modify the delegate manifest file to include a volume mount. Add the following YAML under `spec.template.spec.containers`

```shell
volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle/
    name: custom-certs
    readOnly: true
```

2. Add the following under `spec.template.spec`. Add the secret name with the value you used when you created the kubernetes secret.

```shell
securityContext:
  fsGroup: 1001
volumes:
  - name: custom-certs
    secret:
      secretName: dbops-ssl-secret
      defaultMode: 0440
```

`dbops-ssl-secret` is the name of the secret created in the previous step. Ensure that the secret name matches.

3. Set Environment Variables
  - `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH` ensures the delegate trusts the CA
  - `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` injects certs into ephemeral build pods
  - **`DESTINATION_CA_PATH` cannot be used because multiple certs must be mounted independently**

:::important warning
**Do not use `DESTINATION_CA_PATH` when using `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` to mount certificates into build pods. Instead, use the `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH` environment variable to specify the path to the certificates on the delegate.**
:::

Add the following environment variables to the delegate:

```shell
- name: ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH
  value: "/opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle/ca.bundle"

- name: CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES
  value: "/opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle/ca.bundle:/etc/ssl/certs/dbops/root_ca.crt,/opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle/client.key:/etc/ssl/certs/dbops/client.key,/opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle/client.crt:/etc/ssl/certs/dbops/client.crt"
```

:::info note
When using `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES`, the mounted file paths must be:
  * `/etc/ssl/certs/dbops/root_ca.crt`
  * `/etc/ssl/certs/dbops/client.crt`
  * `/etc/ssl/certs/dbops/client.key`
Also, you must set the `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH` environment variable when using `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES`.
:::

**Why this matters ?**

  - `ADDITIONAL_CERTS_PATH` ensures the delegate trusts the database CA
  - `CI_MOUNT_VOLUMES` injects certs into ephemeral build pods
  - **`DESTINATION_CA_PATH` is not used because multiple certs must be mounted independently**
Restart the delegate after applying changes.

## 5. Enable JDBC SSL Truststore Support

Add the following to the delegate environment:

```shell
- name: INIT_SCRIPT
  value: |-
    
    openssl pkcs12 -export -in /opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle/client.crt -inkey /opt/harness-delegate/ca-bundle/client.key -out client.p12 -name client_pkcs12 -password pass:changeit

    keytool -importkeystore -destkeystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/jssecacerts -srckeystore client.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -alias client_pkcs12 -storepass changeit -srcstorepass changeit -noprompt
```

**What this does ?**
- Combines client cert and key into a PKCS12 file
- Imports it into the Java truststore
- Enables JDBC SSL authentication during test connections

:::info note
* `INIT_SCRIPT` is required because the JDBC Test Connection runs inside the delegate container.
* The delegate automatically imports `ca.bundle` into the default trust store (`$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts`).
* Learn more: [Override trust store for delegates](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/delegates/secure-delegates/trust-store-override-for-delegates/)

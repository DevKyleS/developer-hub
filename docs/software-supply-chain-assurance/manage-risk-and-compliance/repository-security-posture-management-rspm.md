# Repository Security Posture Management - RSPM with Harness SCS

Understanding the security and risk posture of your code repositories is crucial for maintaining a secure development environment and preventing supply chain attacks. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the security and risk posture by presenting detailed insights into various aspects of your repositories. It highlights all the issues related to risk and compliance derived from the code repository configurations generated by applying industry-standard software supply chain benchmarks such as _[CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/software-supply-chain-security), [OWASP Top 10 CI/CD Security Risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-ci-cd-security-risks/)_ etc. 

Additionally, it reveals details of security vulnerabilities through security scanning. Also, it provides an in-depth look into the composition of the repository by generating the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and its quality score. This helps users understand their repositories' security posture and manage them effectively to avoid potential supply chain attacks originating from code repositories and their organizational settings.

The RSPM feature in SCS offers details into:



* **Risk and Compliance Issues**: Provides visibility into all the issues related to risk and compliance derived from code repository configurations and organization settings based on compliance standards.
* **Security Vulnerabilities Detection**: Details of security vulnerabilities identified through SAST, SCA, and Secret scanning.
* **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**: Provides an in-depth look into the composition of the repository by providing a detailed list of dependencies. Additionally, it also offers the quality of the SBOM in various categories, utilizing a scoring system ranging from 0 to 10.

You can click on a repository in the “Code Repositories” section, and it will present all the details specific to each aspect of the repository.

:::info
To onboard your code repositories, refer to the [Get Started](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/get-started/) guide.
:::


## Supported code repositories

The RSPM feature in the Harness SCS module is currently supported only for **GitHub**. Harness plans to add support for other code repositories in the near future.

:::tip

To efficiently onboard a large number of GitHub repositories, set up a single GitHub connector at the account level using [Harness APIs](https://apidocs.harness.io/tag/integration), which enables you to select and onboard repositories for specific projects and automatically create scan pipelines.

:::
## Overview Tab

The overview page provides a comprehensive summary of a specific code repository's security and risk posture. This page compiles all the crucial details in one place, offering a clear and concise view.

:::note

Scans will not run if **Git Experience** is enforced and the **Default Store Type for Entities** is set to remote in the account settings. Make sure these settings are configured correctly to enable scan execution.

### What is an Evaluation?

Before diving into the details, it's essential to understand what an "evaluation" means in this context. An evaluation refers to applying specific compliance rules to the repository and obtaining the results of these checks. Each evaluation assesses the repository against these predefined rules and provides a pass or fail status.


The page offers detailed information about:

* **General Information:** including the name, branch and the latest evaluation timestamp
* **Evaluation Breakdown:** A summary of rules passing versus failing
* **SBOM:** Presents the sum of all the dependencies with an SBOM quality score and an option to download the SBOM.
* **Risk & Compliance Issues and Vulnerabilities:** Breakdown of risk and compliance issues and vulnerabilities into critical, high, medium and low.
* **Evaluation Trend:** This graph presents the trend of evaluations over time, showing the number of rules passing and failing with respect to the date. This helps users visualize the improvement or decline in the security posture of their repositories.

## Risk and Compliance Tab

In this tab, you will find a list of rules applied to the repository, each accompanied by its name and the compliance standard to which it belongs. The latest status indicates whether the rule has passed or failed in the most recent evaluation, along with the date and time of the last evaluation. The evaluation history column shows the rule's status (passed or failed) over the last 7 evaluations, providing a clear view of its compliance trend.

Filters can help you narrow down the rules based on severity, including low, medium, high, and critical levels. You can filter the rules by their evaluation status, such as passed, failed, or all.

## SBOM(Software Bill of Materials) Tab

The SBOM section provides a comprehensive view of your repository’s dependencies. It includes a total dependency count and a detailed, searchable inventory. For each dependency, it surfaces key information such as name, version, OSS Risks, license, package manager, PURL (Package URL), supplier, and vulnerabilities.

Use the following options to filter and refine the dependency list:

* **Dependency**: Find specific dependencies based on the dependency name and values. Click Dependency to specify the condition for the `Dependency` Name. Optionally, you can specify the condition for the Dependency Version as well.
* **License**: Find specific dependencies based on the type of license associated with them. Click `License` to specify the condition for the License associated with a dependency.
* **OSS Risks**: Filter and refine all the dependencies related to particular OSS Risks. Click `OSS Risks` and then select the checkboxes next to the desired risks in the list to filter the dependencies accordingly. The available options are [Known vulnerabilities in dependencies](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/manage-risk-and-compliance/opensource-security-risk-management#vulnerabilities-in-sbom-components-oss-risk---1), [Unmaintained Components Identified](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/manage-risk-and-compliance/opensource-security-risk-management#unmaintained-components-oss-risk---4), [Outdated Components Identified](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/manage-risk-and-compliance/opensource-security-risk-management#outdated-components-oss-risk---5), [End of Life](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/manage-risk-and-compliance/opensource-security-risk-management#end-of-life-components), and [Close to End of Life](/docs/software-supply-chain-assurance/manage-risk-and-compliance/opensource-security-risk-management#close-to-end-of-life-components).
* **Dependency Type**: Filter dependencies based on the dependency relationship to your project. Click `Dependency Type` and then select the checkboxes next to the desired dependency type to filter the dependencies. The available options are `Direct`, `Indirect`, and `No relationship`.
  * **Direct** - Dependencies explicitly declared in your project configuration.
  * **Indirect** - Transitive dependencies brought in by other dependencies.
  * **No relationship** - Dependencies present in the SBOM but not currently mapped to your project’s dependency graph.
  :::note

  * Filtering dependencies via dependency type is available only for code repositories.

  * Currently, direct dependencies are identified only for a limited set of build tools and ecosystems, including `Maven`, `Gradle`, `npm`, `Yarn`, `pip`, `Conda`, and `Go modules`, based on supported manifest files.

  :::

* **Package Manager**: Filter dependencies by package manager. Enter a package manager name in the corresponding search box to view all matching dependencies.
* **Supplier**: Filter dependencies by supplier. Enter a supplier name in the corresponding search box to view all matching dependencies.

Additionally, click the `Download SBOM` button to download the dependency list in JSON format.

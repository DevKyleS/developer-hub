Currently, the Centralised Notification feature is behind the feature flag `PL_CENTRAL_NOTIFICATIONS`. Contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable them.

Harness Centralized Notifications enable you to send notifications based on rules and conditions across pipelines, delegates, and other Harness entities. With notifications management, you can easily configure and manage alerts to stay informed about critical events.

Centralized notifications can be configured for the following resource types:

1. Pipeline 
2. Delegate 

This article explains how to configure notifications for Pipelines and Delegates in Harness across different [scopes](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/rbac-in-harness/#permissions-hierarchy-scopes).

This guide uses the Account scope as an example, but the steps apply similarly to Organization and Project scopes. To configure notifications, follow the steps below.

1. Navigate to **Account Settings** â†’ **General**, select **Notifications Management**. 

        ![account-level-notification](./static/organization-setting-notification-management.png)

2. In the **Overview** section, provide a **Notification Name** and click **Continue**. Then, select the appropriate **Resource Type**. Depending on your selection, proceed with either the **Pipeline** or **Delegate** tab.

   :::info Note
   Stage start, success, and failure events apply to all stages in a pipeline. For more granular control (such as specific stages), consider using [pipeline-level notifications](/docs/continuous-delivery/x-platform-cd-features/cd-steps/notify-users-of-pipeline-events.md).
   :::

   Provide a **Condition Name**, select relevant **Pipeline Events**, and click **Continue** to choose the notification channel.

   - Optionally you can add **Notification Template** to get custom notifications based on the event. To learn more, go to [Custom Notification templates for Pipeline Notifications](/docs/platform/templates/customized-notification-template).

Notification settings allow you to control which notification channels are available across your Harness account. These settings are managed at the account scope and apply to all organizations and projects within the account.

By default, all supported notification channels are enabled. Organizations and projects inherit the account-level notification settings and cannot override them.

When a notification channel is disabled at the account level:
   - No notifications are sent through that channel.
   - This applies to both existing and newly configured notifications.
   - Notifications resume automatically when the channel is enabled.

Harness supports the following notification channels:
   - Slack
   - Microsoft Teams
   - Webhooks
   - PagerDuty
   - Email
   - Datadog

---

## Manage notification 

To enable or disable a notification channel, navigate to **Account Settings** > **Account Resources** > **Default Settings** > **Notifications**, and use the corresponding toggle.

### Email filters

Email filters allow you to restrict where notifications are sent by enforcing a domain allowlist at the account level. When enabled, notifications are delivered only to email addresses included in the allowlist.

Only fixed domains are supported. Expression-based URLs or dynamic domains are not allowed.

**Example**: If you add `example.com` to the email filters, only email addresses from that domain such as `alerts@example.com` will receive notifications.

### Emails for platform limit alerts

:::note Feature Availability
Currently, the platform limit alerts feature is behind the feature flag `PL_ENABLE_LIMIT_ALERTS_NOTIFICATIONS`. Please, contact [Harness Support](mailto:support@harness.io) to enable this feature.
:::

You can configure email recipients to receive alerts as your account approaches the default [platform resource limits](/docs/platform/account-license-limits). Email alerts are sent when usage reaches 80%, 95%, and 100% of the allowed limit, giving you visibility and time to act. You can add up to five email addresses to receive these alerts.

Platform limits are enforced at the account level, and these alerts help you proactively manage usage before limits are reached.

#### Platform Resource Mapping 

These variables are used in email notifications to alert users when platform resources are approaching their limits. You can find more about the platform resource limits [here](/docs/platform/account-license-limits/).

| Resource Name    | Resource Variable                                   |

## Get started with pipeline notifications

Learn how to notify users of different pipeline events using popular notification methods.

### Prerequisites

* You need a Harness pipeline with active delegates and connectors. You can follow the [tutorial to get started with Harness Continuous Delivery (CD)](/docs/continuous-delivery/get-started/tutorials/kubernetes-container-deployments/manifest) to set up a sample pipeline.
* These steps use [Harness user groups](/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-user-groups/) to manage user access. If you want to follow along, create a user group named `notification-demo` at the account level, and then add yourself as a user in that group.

### Configure New Channels to sent notification

A new channel can be configured across all scopes. To set up a channel, go to Settings for your desired scope → General → Notification Management, and click Channels as shown below:

   ![](./static/notify-channel.gif)

1. Click New Channel and enter a Channel Name.
            
   ![](./static/new-channel.png)

2. Choose a Connectivity Mode — you can send notifications either directly through the Harness Platform or via a Harness Delegate.

   ![connectivity-mode](./static/connectiviy-mode.png)

   If you choose to send notifications through a Harness Delegate, select the appropriate delegate in the Delegate Setup window.

   ![delegate-mode](./static/delegate-setup.png)

3. Notification Method: Once the connectivity mode is configured, select the [**Channel Type**](#configure-pipeline-notifications) and add details related to the channel type to proceed.
            
   :::note
   If you select the Connectivity Mode as "Connect through a Harness Delegate" and Channel Type as "Email", ensure to add an [SMTP configuration](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/notifications/add-smtp-configuration) to which the Harness delegate has access. If this is not done, then the Email notifications will fail.

In Harness IDP, a Self Service Workflow (also known as a software template in Backstage) enables platform engineers to automate the process of service creation. As a platform engineer, you can create a Workflows that prompts developers for details and creates a repository with a basic setup that includes a CI/CD process. The Workflow is defined in a YAML file named `workflow.yaml`. The [syntax](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/input-examples) of the Workflow definition is owned by [backstage.io](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/writing-templates) while the Workflow runs on a Harness pipeline of your choice.

## How to write IDP Workflows

Workflows in Harness IDP is powered by the Backstage Software Template. You can create your own Workflows with a small YAML definition which describes the Workflow and its metadata, along with some input variables that your Workflow will need, and then a list of actions which are then executed by the scaffolding service. Here's an example Workflow definition YAML:

</details>

Let's dive in and pick apart what each of these sections do and what they are.

## Frontend of the Workflow

In a Workflow, the **input parameters** are the first interaction point for developers. They define the structure and types of data needed to initiate the onboarding process.

1. **Parameter Types**:
   Workflow definition can accept a wide range of input types, such as:
   - **String**: Simple text fields used for names, IDs, or environment types.
   - **Integer**: Used for numeric inputs, such as setting a quota or defining age limits.
   - **Array**: Useful for handling multiple inputs, like a list of dependencies or services.
   - **Object**: When using more complex structures, nested fields can be defined using object types.
   
2. **User Interaction and Validation**:
   - Inputs can include UI widgets that make user interaction easier. For example, a string input can have a `ui:field` of [`OwnerPicker`](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/custom-extensions#ownerpicker) to allow users to select team members from a dropdown list. 

   - **Default values**: You can set default values for parameters to guide users on commonly used values, making onboarding quicker and more user-friendly.
   - **Field Dependency**: Input fields can be made dynamic using `anyOf` or `allOf`, where only certain fields become visible based on the userâ€™s previous choices. For instance, selecting a "production" environment could trigger additional input fields for production-specific configurations.
   
3. **Required Fields**:
   Templates allow developers to enforce required fields. For example, the field `age` or `owner` could be marked as mandatory, ensuring critical data is not skipped during onboarding.

### `spec.parameters` - `FormStep | FormStep[]`

These `parameters` are Workflow variables which can be modified in the frontend as a sequence. It can either be one `Step` if you just want one big list of different fields in the frontend, or it can be broken up into multiple different steps which would be rendered as different steps in the scaffolder plugin frontend.

Each `Step` is `JSONSchema` with some extra goodies for styling what it might look like in the frontend. For these steps we rely very heavily on this [library](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form). They have some [great docs](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/docs/) and a [playground](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form) where you can play around with some examples.

There's another option for that library called `uiSchema` which we've taken advantage of, and we've merged it with the existing `JSONSchema` that you provide to the library. These are the little `ui:*` properties that you can see in the step definitions.

**[Read More on building the Workflows Frontend](/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/flows-input)**

For example if we take the **simple** example from the playground it looks like this:

<details>
<summary>Example json</summary>

```json
// jsonSchema:
{
  "title": "A registration form",
  "description": "A simple form example.",
  "type": "object",
  "required": [
    "firstName",
    "lastName"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "firstName": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "First name",
      "default": "Chuck"
    },
    "lastName": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Last name"
    },
    "nicknames":{
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "telephone": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Telephone",
      "minLength": 10
    }
  }
}

// uiSchema:
{
  "firstName": {
    "ui:autofocus": true,
    "ui:emptyValue": "",
    "ui:autocomplete": "given-name"
  },
  "lastName": {
    "ui:emptyValue": "",
    "ui:autocomplete": "family-name"
  },
  "nicknames": {
    "ui:options":{
      "orderable": false
    }
  },
  "telephone": {
    "ui:options": {
      "inputType": "tel"
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

It would look something like the following in a Workflow definition YAML:

<details>
<summary>Example YAML</summary>

```YAML
apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: v1beta3-demo
  title: Test Action template
  description: scaffolder v1beta3 template demo
spec:
  owner: backstage/techdocs-core
  type: service

  parameters:
    - title: A registration form
      description: A simple form example.
      type: object
      required:
        - firstName
        - lastName
      properties:
        firstName:
          type: string
          title: First name
          default: Chuck
          ui:autofocus: true
          ui:emptyValue: ''
          ui:autocomplete: given-name
        lastName:
          type: string
          title: Last name
          ui:emptyValue: ''
          ui:autocomplete: family-name
        nicknames:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
          ui:options:
            orderable: false
        telephone:
          type: string
          title: Telephone
          minLength: 10
          ui:options:
            inputType: tel
```

</details>

### Adding the owner

By default the [owner](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/catalog/how-to-create-idp-yaml#spec-owner) is of type **Group** which is same as the **[User Group](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/role-based-access-control/add-user-groups/#built-in-user-groups)** in Harness. In case the owner is a user you have to mention it as `user:default/debabrata.panigrahi` and it should only contain the user name not the complete email id. 

A simple `workflow.yaml` definition might look something like this:

```YAML {4,9}
...
# these are the steps which are rendered in the frontend with the form input
spec:
  owner: debabrata.panigrahi@harness.io
  type: service
  parameters:
    - title: Service Details
      properties:   
        owner:
          title: Choose an Owner for the Service
          type: string
          ui:field: OwnerPicker
          ui:options:
            allowedKinds:
              - Group
        # This field is hidden but needed to authenticate the request to trigger the pipeline
        token:
          title: Harness Token
          type: string
          ui:widget: password
          ui:field: HarnessAuthToken
...

```

## Building the Workflow Backend

### `spec.steps` - `Action[]`: Action Customization

**Steps** are the core execution units within Workflows. Each step runs an action that might involve triggering a CI/CD pipeline, creating a service in a catalog, or provisioning infrastructure resources. The inputs gathered from the user are passed into these steps, and the outputs are generated based on the results of each step.

Actions within steps can be customized to fit various use cases, such as:

- **Creating Repositories**: Using `[trigger:harness-custom-pipeline](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/custom-actions#1-triggerharness-custom-pipeline)` and execute a pipeline with [create-repo stage](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/idp-stage#3-create-repo) to generate a new repository based on the provided input.
- **Logging Data**: Using `debug:log` to display or log specific information about the inputs.
- **Triggering Pipelines**: Using `[trigger:harness-custom-pipeline](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/custom-actions#1-triggerharness-custom-pipeline)` to pipelines in Harness for various actions like creating repository, [onboarding new service](https://developer.harness.io/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/create-a-new-service-using-idp-stage), etc. 

These follow the same standard format:

```yaml
- id: fetch-base # A unique id for the step
  name: Fetch Base # A title displayed in the frontend
  if: ${{ parameters.name }} # Optional condition, skip the step if not truthy
  each: ${{ parameters.iterable }} # Optional iterable, run the same step multiple times
  action: fetch:template # An action to call
  input: # Input that is passed as arguments to the action handler
    url: ./template
    values:
      name: ${{ parameters.name }}
```

By default we ship some [built in actions](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/builtin-actions) along with some [custom actions](/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/custom-actions).

When `each` is provided, the current iteration value is available in the `${{ each }}` input.

Examples:

```yaml
each: ['apples', 'oranges']
input:
  values:
    fruit: ${{ each.value }}
```

```yaml
each: [{ name: 'apple', count: 3 }, { name: 'orange', count: 1 }]
input:
  values:
    fruit: ${{ each.value.name }}
    count: ${{ each.value.count }}
```

When `each` is used, the outputs of a repeated step are returned as an array of outputs from each iteration.

### Using Harness Pipeline as an Orchestrator

Harness Pipelines serve as powerful orchestrators for Workflows. In this setup you can trigger Harness pipelines directly through a [Workflow Action](/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/custom-actions#1-triggerharness-custom-pipeline). This action accepts the Harness pipeline URL as input, alongside an automatically inserted authentication token under the parameters section just like other inputs required for the pipeline execution. This seamless integration is enabled by Harness IDP being part of the broader Harness SaaS ecosystem, allowing users to even manage Workflows through pipelines RBAC. [Read More](/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/flows-output#harness-pipeline-as-orchestrator)

### Configuring the Output

1. **Links to Generated Resources**
The output can generate direct links to newly created resources such as Git repositories, documentation pages, or CI/CD pipelines. This gives the developer immediate access to manage or monitor their newly onboarded resources.

**Example**:  

```YAML
output:
  links:
    - title: "Repository Link"
      url: "${{ steps['repo-create'].output.repoUrl }}"
    - title: "Pipeline Dashboard"
      url: "${{ steps['deploy-pipeline'].output.pipelineUrl }}"

```

2. **Service Metadata and Status**
Output can include status messages or metadata from the onboarding process. For example, details about a service registration or the progress of resource provisioning (success/failure messages) can be returned as output.

**Example**:  

```YAML
output:
  text:
    - title: "Service Registration Status"
      content: "Service registration completed with status: `${{ steps['register-service'].output.status }}`
```


3. **Generated Files and Artifacts**
Developers can configure templates to generate files (e.g., README.md, YAML configuration files) or artifacts (e.g., Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests) during onboarding.

**Example**:  

```YAML
output:
  links:
    - title: "Generated README"
      url: "${{ steps['create-readme'].output.fileUrl }}"
    - title: "Kubernetes Manifest"
      url: "${{ steps['generate-manifest'].output.fileUrl }}"
```


4. **Dynamic Outputs Based on Inputs**
Outputs can be conditional based on inputs. For instance, if a user selected the "production" environment during onboarding, the output could include production-specific links (e.g., monitoring dashboards, production CI/CD pipelines).

Each individual step can output some variables that can be used in the Workflow frontend for after the job is finished. This is useful for things like linking to the entity that has been created with the backend, linking to the created repository, or showing Markdown text blobs. **[Read more on how to configure output](/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/flows-output.md)**. 

```YAMl
output:
  links:
    - title: Repository
      url: ${{ steps['publish'].output.remoteUrl }} # link to the remote repository
    - title: Open in catalog
      icon: catalog
      entityRef: ${{ steps['register'].output.entityRef }} # link to the entity that has been ingested to the catalog
  text:
    - title: More information
      content: |
        **Entity URL:** `${{ steps['publish'].output.remoteUrl }}`
```

## Template registration

A template is a kind of entity that exists in the software catalog. You can create a `template.yaml` file and register the URL with the catalog. For information about registering a template, go to [Add a new software component to the catalog](/docs/internal-developer-portal/get-started/register-a-new-software-component.md).

## Delete/Unregister Template

1. Navigate to the **Catalog** page, and select **Template** under Kind.

![](./static/catalog-navigation.png)

2. Select the Template Name you want to Unregister.
3. Now on the Template overview page, click on the 3 dots on top right corner and select **Unregister Entity**.

![](./static/unregister-entity.png)

4. Now on the Dialog box select **Unregister Location**.

![](./static/Unregister-location.png)

5. This will delete the Template.

## Available Workflow Actions

:::info

Please refer to the [support matrix](/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/custom-actions#custom-actions-usage-limitations) for custom actions before using them, also all input, except for [pipeline input as variables](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/harness-variables/#pipeline-expressions), must be of [fixed value](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/variables-and-expressions/runtime-inputs/#fixed-values). 

![](./static/pipeline-varialbles-idp-implementation.png)

:::

Harness IDP ships the following Harness related built-in actions along with [some others](/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/custom-actions.md) to be used in the software template steps.

- `trigger:harness-custom-pipeline`
- `trigger:trigger-pipeline-with-webhook`
- `harness:create-secret`
- `harness:delete-secret`

Learn more about how to use them in the [service onboarding tutorial](/docs/internal-developer-portal/tutorials/using-secret-as-an-input).

## Available Workflow UI pickers

Harness IDP ships the following [Workflows UI pickers](/docs/internal-developer-portal/flows/custom-actions.md) that can be used in the template form for developers to select from.

- `HarnessOrgPicker`
- `HarnessProjectPicker`
- `HarnessAutoOrgPicker`

You can use these UI fields in the `ui:field` option of your `template.yaml` file. Read more about how to use these [custom field extensions](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/writing-custom-field-extensions#using-the-custom-field-extension) or take a look at [this example](https://github.com/bhavya-sinha/scaffolder-sample-templates/blob/5f52718ec49cb2c27a87e2fbeae075873701911c/fieldExtension.yaml#L78-L85).

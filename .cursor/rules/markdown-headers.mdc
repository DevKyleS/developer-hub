# Markdown Header Style

Headers should be instructive and direct, not suggestive or descriptive.

## ❌ Bad: Gerunds (avoid -ing forms)

```markdown
## Installing Dependencies
## Configuring the API
## Running Tests
## Understanding the Architecture
```

## ✅ Good: Instructive Commands

```markdown
## Install Dependencies
## Configure the API
## Run Tests
## Understand the Architecture
```

## More Examples

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use |
|---------|--------|
| Creating a Pipeline | Create a Pipeline |
| Setting Up Authentication | Set Up Authentication |
| Deploying to Production | Deploy to Production |
| Managing Users | Manage Users |
| Building the Project | Build the Project |

## Exception

Gerunds are acceptable when describing ongoing processes or concepts:
- "Understanding CI/CD" as a section title in learning material
- "Troubleshooting" as a dedicated section for debugging

But prefer imperative forms when giving instructions to readers.

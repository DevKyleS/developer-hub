# Documentation Structure Template

Follow this structure when creating new documentation pages. Adjust as needed based on content type.

## Standard Structure

### 1. Frontmatter
```yaml
---
title: [Clear, descriptive title]
description: [One-sentence summary of what this guide covers]
---
```

### 2. Introduction (2-3 paragraphs)
- **Paragraph 1**: What is this feature/capability?
- **Paragraph 2**: Why use it? What problems does it solve?
- **Paragraph 3**: Key benefits or use cases

### 3. Prerequisites
List required setup, permissions, or knowledge:
```markdown
## Prerequisites

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

### 4. Step-by-Step Instructions
Use clear, numbered sections with imperative headers:

```markdown
## Step 1: [Action verb]

Instructions here.

:::tip
Add troubleshooting hints inline when they help anticipate common issues.
:::

## Step 2: [Action verb]

More instructions.
```

**When to include inline troubleshooting:**
- Common errors that happen during this specific step
- Configuration gotchas that prevent progress
- Quick fixes that keep the user moving forward

### 5. Troubleshooting Section (Optional)
Only include if there are general issues not tied to specific steps:

```markdown
## Troubleshooting

### Issue: [Description of problem]
**Solution:** [How to fix it]
```

### 6. Next Steps
Wrap up with:
- **Brief conclusion** (1-2 sentences): Summarize what was accomplished
- **2-3 related links**: Most logical next actions or related docs

```markdown
## Next Steps

You've successfully [accomplished X]. You can now [key capability unlocked].

- [Related doc 1]
- [Related doc 2]
- [Related doc 3]
```

## Content Guidelines

- Use imperative headers (Create, Configure, Set up)
- Keep prerequisites minimal and relevant
- Include code examples where helpful
- Use callouts (:::tip, :::warning, :::info) strategically
- Link to related concepts inline, not just at the end
